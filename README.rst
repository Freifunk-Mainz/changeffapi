FFFlash
=======

This Program helps to manage `Freifunk APIfiles <https://api.freifunk.net/>`_.

To use it you need an existing APIfile. `Create one here <http://freifunk.net/api-generator/>`_ if necessary.


Commandline
-----------

There is no configuration.

Everything **ffflash** needs to know is passed each time as shell parameters. (It's not much).

* To get help, use ``ffflash.py -h``::

    usage: ffflash [-h] [-n NODELIST] [-r RANKFILE]
               [-s SIDECARS [SIDECARS ...]] [-d] [-v]

* You always need to pass the location to your ``APIfile``.

* ``--nodelist`` or ``-n`` expects the full url of your ``nodelist.json`` file, generated by the `ffmap-backend <https://github.com/ffnord/ffmap-backend>`_.

* Do some number crunching and store the results in the ``--rankfile``.
    Only works if passed together with an ``--nodelist``.

* Pass one or more ``--sidecars`` (or ``-s``) to merge content from there into the APIfile.

* Use ``--dry`` (or ``-d``) to preview all changes. Then, nothing is written to the APIfile!

* If both ``-s`` and ``-n`` are omitted, no action is taken. So to just display your APIfile you could use this::

    ffflash.py /path/to/your/ffapi_file.json -d


* The ``--verbose`` (or ``-v``) switch just displays more information.
